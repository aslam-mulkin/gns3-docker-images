# fileserv - FTP, TFTP and SSH Server

This image provides an (anonymous) FTP, TFTP and SSH server.
For SSH use user ftp, password ftp.

The security is very lax, so don't use it in a security
sensitive environment.

I use it mainly for saving/restoring configs on network elements
and as a test image for the GNS3 docker functionality.
