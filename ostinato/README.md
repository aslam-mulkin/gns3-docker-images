# Ostinato appliance

Ostinato is an open-source, cross-platform network packet
crafter/traffic generator and analyzer with a friendly GUI.
Craft and send packets of several streams with different
protocols at different rates.

It's possible to control the ostinato server/drone from
an external ostinato GUI. Select any interface as a
controlling interface, connect it via a cloud connection
to the outside and setup IP in the node configuration.
